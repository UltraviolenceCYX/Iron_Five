# Implement eDSL for finite state machine (Moore) 2B

## Group name and list of group members
*group name:* Iron Five 

*list of group members* 

+ Chen Yuxing
+ Li Sicheng

## variant description
- Sub variants define the type of finite state machine:
(a) Mealy
(b) Moore
- you should use the default Python logging module to make the interpreter work transparent.
- Visualization as a state diagram (GraphViz DOT) and table (in the pretty markdown format), example you can see in section .
- Provide a complex example with a physical system controller like an elevator, crossroad
with a traffic light, etc.

## contribution summary for each group member
- Chen yuxing: Write input data control, state machine model visualization and the ReadMe file. 
- Li sicheng: Write write and test the state machine for a traffic light.

## work demonstration
Just open the file which starts with Test. Write click and click Run "UnitTest for xxxxxx".Then we can see that the results are correct.Open the file with suffix '.gv', we can the picture of state machine(Moore)
